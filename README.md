Meteor packages for a great React developer experience

### Linting

Run

```
npm run lint
```

Note this does not yet all lint. Working on it.

### Testing

Due to difficulties in testing packages with "peer" NPM dependencies, we've worked around by moving package tests into harness test apps. You can find them in `tests/`.

To run tests for a Meteor react package, navigate to its `tests/*` app and execute `npm test`.
